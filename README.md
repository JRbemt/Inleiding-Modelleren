# Inleiding-Modelleren
Rough model of the logistics of the bus lines 401 &amp; 402 in Eindhoven/ Veldhoven.<br>
<a href="https://jrbemt.github.io/Inleiding-Modelleren/.">The model </a> is school project for the course: "Inleiding Modelleren". <br>
Model uses .csv files to read in data, download all files in "master/Data/" and upload them at the starting screen.

The design still has multiple flaws due to a lack of time:
<ul>
  <li> Settings like the bus line (401 & 402) are hardcoded</li>
  <li> Busses only go 1 way</li>
  <li> Some assumptions, and stochastic elements</li>
</ul>
